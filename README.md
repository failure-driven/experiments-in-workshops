# Experiminets in Workshop

Ideas on how to run a workshop, intially on testing.

## Random thoughs

- [ ] how to deal with environment setup
    - [ ] github code spaces?
- [ ] how to deal with transitioning in code updates, student created vs
  requried for the next section
    - [ ] branches
    - [ ] patches
    - [ ] separate directory? packwerk package for rails?
- [ ] basic "Outside in BDD" workshop
    - the hypothesis is
    > "lot's of new people to the industry know how to code, but they don't
    > know how to get started to build out a complete product"
    - [ ] demonstrate how BDD flow can benefit an existing application - "add
      AI messages to guest book"
    - [ ] use AI chat to generate a general set of acceptance criteria for the
      product: blog, marketplace, social platform, etc
    - [ ] basic setup for BDD/TDD web in your platform of choice: Rails,
      Node(Next? other?), Angular + API, etc
    - [ ] drive out the first flow and associated TDD unit specs
    - [ ] cover off CRUD, background jobs, external services and hexagonal
      architecture
    - [ ] touch on microservices and contract testing
    - [ ] other kinds of testing - property based, random
    - [ ] tracking business level success throught statsd/OpenTelemetry?
